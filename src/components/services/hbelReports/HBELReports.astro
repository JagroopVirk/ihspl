      Toxicological Risk Assessment: <span class="halfHeading">A Scientific Foundation for Human Health Protection</span
      >
    </h1>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      In the context of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and medical device industries, Toxicological Risk Assessment
      (TRA) represents a cornerstone of human health protection. TRA systematically evaluates the potential adverse
      health effects resulting from exposure to chemical substances—whether intentionally added or unintentionally
      present. This scientific evaluation informs critical decisions in product development, manufacturing, and
      regulatory submissions.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      TRA encompasses a variety of services and methodologies to identify, characterize, and quantify the risk
      associated with chemical exposures. With increasing regulatory scrutiny and a growing emphasis on product safety,
      industries are adopting comprehensive toxicological evaluations to maintain compliance with international
      guidelines like ICH Q3A/B/C, ICH Q3(D), ICH M7, and ISO standards for medical devices.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      As global regulatory expectations evolve, TRA has transitioned from a supportive function to a central requirement
      in ensuring the safety of patients, healthcare professionals, and manufacturing personnel. This article elucidates
      the key applications and methodologies of TRA, with emphasis on its role in cleaning validation, impurity
      evaluation, occupational safety, and medical device assessments.

      <summary>I. Toxicological Risk Assessment of Medical Devices</summary>
      <div class="mt-4 space-y-3">
        <p>
          Medical devices, particularly those classified under Class II and III, are composed of complex polymeric and
          metallic materials that may release extractables and leachables (E&Ls). These substances can migrate into the
          body under physiological conditions and warrant thorough toxicological scrutiny.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2">
          <li>Chemical characterization in accordance with ISO 10993-18 to identify potential E&Ls.</li>
          <li>Quantitative risk assessment using patient exposure estimates, often expressed in µg/day or mg/day.</li>
          <li>Toxicological threshold derivation based on established values such as PDE or TTC.</li>
          <li>Application of ISO 10993-17 to determine cumulative exposure risk.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Such evaluations are essential for CE marking in the EU, FDA submissions in the US, and compliance with MDR
          and global ISO standards.
