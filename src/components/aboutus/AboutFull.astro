          In 2018, inside a single-room office tucked away in a modest corner of the city, two determined
          professionals—Dr. Upendra Jain and Ms. Veena Kumari—laid the foundation of what would become Indivirtus
          Healthcare Services. There were no lavish resources, no financial safety nets, just a bold vision and an
          unwavering belief in the power of expertise and ethical consulting. Long hours were spent huddled over medical
          data, poring through regulations, and crafting reports that adhered not only to the letter of the law but also
          to the spirit of patient safety and industry integrity. From the very beginning, Indivirtus was not just
          another healthcare consultancy. It was a dream to bring world-class toxicological and regulatory insight to
          every corner of the pharmaceutical industry—one client, one report, one breakthrough at a time.

          The company’s early days were defined by its specialization in Toxicological Risk Assessment. At a time when
          regulatory landscapes were becoming increasingly complex and demanding, Indivirtus stood out by offering
          reports that were not only technically precise but also comprehensible and actionable. This rare combination
          of scientific depth and client-focused clarity helped Indivirtus quickly gain a loyal client base. From
          calculating Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) limits to ensuring adherence to EMA and ICH guidelines, each
          assessment became a cornerstone of client trust. And slowly, that trust transformed into referrals.
          Pharmaceutical manufacturers who had long struggled with regulatory complexities now had a partner who not
          only understood their pain points but also offered reliable, timely solutions with integrity.

          Growth was never rushed—but it was inevitable. With each new client came a deeper understanding of the
          challenges faced by the industry. The demand wasn’t limited to toxicology anymore. Clients began to seek
          guidance in regulatory dossier submissions, genotoxic impurity evaluations, and even calibration and clinical
          trial support. And so, Indivirtus responded—expanding its capabilities in a thoughtful, strategic manner.
          Departments were built one by one, not for the sake of expansion, but because the need for those services was
          real and pressing. Pharmacovigilance soon became a key offering, with services ranging from PSMF management to
          global literature monitoring. Calibration labs were set up under NABL accreditation, and training sessions
          were organized to empower clients with knowledge on GMP, cleaning validation, and quality systems. All of this
          unfolded organically—driven by the company's foundational belief: solve real problems, and growth will follow.

          By 2024, Indivirtus had evolved from a small consultancy into a dynamic, international organization. With over
          100 employees, spread across seven global offices, and structured as a group of five interconnected companies,
          the vision had transformed into a robust enterprise. More than 500 clients across 45+ countries had now
          experienced the Indivirtus promise. Our teams had participated in countless regulatory submissions, helped
          streamline product approvals, facilitated technology transfers, and ensured compliance in clinical
          environments around the world. Through all of this, what remained constant was the company’s deep-rooted
          commitment to precision, transparency, and care. Indivirtus didn’t just grow in size—it grew in depth,
          capability, and trust.

          And yet, despite all the milestones, awards, and recognitions, Indivirtus continues to see itself as a company
          on a journey. A journey fueled by curiosity, compassion, and courage. We remain as committed today as we were
          in 2018—to offering scientific excellence with a human touch. To every new client, every new challenge, and
          every new regulation, we bring the same sense of responsibility and dedication. Because for us, success isn't
          defined by the number of clients or countries—but by the lives improved, the quality standards elevated, and
          the trust we've built. This is our story. And it’s only just begun.
