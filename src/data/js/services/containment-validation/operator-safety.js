    'Advanced operator safety evaluations for pharmaceutical facilities - from routine exposure monitoring to comprehensive containment effectiveness studies.',
  full_description:
    'Our Operator Safety Testing service provides scientifically rigorous protection for personnel handling hazardous pharmaceutical substances. We employ a multi-modal assessment approach including: real-time personal exposure monitoring with direct-reading instruments (DRI), full-shift breathing zone sampling using OSHA-compliant methods, fluorescent tracer surrogate studies for visual contamination mapping, and wipe sampling with sensitive analytical methods (LC-MS/MS for potent compounds). Our assessments evaluate all exposure pathways - inhalation, dermal, and potential ingestion risks - benchmarked against OELs, ADEs, and OEB classifications. For sterile operations, we include aseptic technique evaluation and gowning validation. All studies culminate in actionable containment improvement plans aligned with ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) principles and ISPE Risk-MaPP guidelines.',
