  full_description:
    "Our Isolator Qualification service provides complete lifecycle validation for pharmaceutical isolators in compliance with EU GMP Annex 1 (2022) and FDA requirements. We specialize in both sterile processing isolators (for aseptic operations) and containment isolators (for high-potency APIs). Our qualification approach includes: 3D airflow mapping using smoke studies, HEPA/ULPA filter certification to ISO 14644-3 standards, automated glove integrity testing with pressure decay methodology, VHP cycle validation using biological indicators (BI) and chemical indicators (CI), and potent compound containment verification using surrogate testing. For advanced applications, we offer isolator-robot interface qualification and closed system validation for ATMP manufacturing.",
