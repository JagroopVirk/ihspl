    'Quantitative evaluation of pharmaceutical containment systems using engineered surrogate materials and advanced detection methods.',
  full_description:
    'Our Surrogate Powder Testing service provides scientifically rigorous validation of containment systems for potent compound handling. We employ a multi-modal approach using: fluorescent tracers (sodium fluorescein) for visual breach detection, engineered lactose/naproxen blends matching target API particle characteristics, and specialized surrogate APIs for biologics. Our testing includes real-time airborne particle monitoring with simultaneous video recording, 3D contamination mapping using UV-visible tracers, and quantitative analysis via HPLC with detection limits to ng/cm¬≤. For cytotoxic applications, we offer ultra-sensitive LC-MS/MS analysis. All studies are designed per ISPE SMEPAC guidelines and include worst-case scenario simulations (equipment failures, improper PPE use) to stress-test containment strategies. Results are benchmarked against OELs and presented with actionable engineering controls to achieve ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) conditions.',
