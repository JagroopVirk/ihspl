    'Our Containment Performance Testing service provides rigorous evaluation of pharmaceutical containment systems using SMEPAC (Standardized Measurement of Equipment Particulate Airborne Concentration) methodologies. We specialize in quantifying containment effectiveness for facilities handling potent compounds, cytotoxic drugs, and hazardous APIs. The service includes airborne particulate monitoring, surface contamination mapping, personal breathing zone sampling, and gravimetric/chemical analysis to verify compliance with occupational exposure limits (OELs). Our testing protocols align with ISPE Good Practice Guides and global GMP requirements, providing actionable data to optimize containment strategies and protect both personnel and product integrity.',
