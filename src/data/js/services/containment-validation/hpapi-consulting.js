  full_description:
    'Our Environmental Monitoring (EM) program provides scientifically rigorous contamination control for pharmaceutical and biotech facilities. We implement risk-based monitoring strategies aligned with EU GMP Annex 1 (2022) requirements for Contamination Control Strategy (CCS). Our services include: real-time non-viable particle monitoring with statistical process control (SPC) analysis, viable air sampling using both active (impaction) and passive (settle plates) methods, surface monitoring with contact plates and swabs (including ATP bioluminescence for cleaning verification), and personnel monitoring via glove and gown sampling. For aseptic processing areas, we offer enhanced monitoring with frequent sampling and rapid microbial methods (RMM). Our data analytics include trend reports, alert/action limit analysis, and contamination investigation support to maintain your facility in a state of control.',
