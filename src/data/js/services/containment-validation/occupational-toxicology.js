  full_description:
    'Our Occupational Toxicology service provides comprehensive health risk assessment for pharmaceutical compounds, combining regulatory expertise with advanced toxicological methodologies. We specialize in: derivation of Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) using NOAEL/LOAEL data with species-specific allometric scaling, calculation of Acceptable Daily Exposures (ADEs) for cross-contamination control, and Occupational Exposure Banding (OEB) classification per global frameworks. For novel modalities (ATMPs, oligonucleotides, ADCs), we apply modified risk assessment approaches. Our team also conducts facility-wide risk mapping using FMEA methodologies to identify critical exposure points, and develops compound-specific control strategies aligned with ISPE Risk-MaPP and EMA HBEL guidelines. All assessments include detailed uncertainty analysis and are presented with clear implementation roadmaps for engineering controls and PPE strategies.',
