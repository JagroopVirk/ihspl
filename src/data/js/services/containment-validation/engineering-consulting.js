  full_description:
    'Our Containment Engineering Consulting service provides comprehensive technical support for pharmaceutical manufacturers handling potent compounds, sterile products, and hazardous APIs. We combine regulatory expertise with practical engineering solutions to optimize containment strategies across your facility. Our services include 3D airflow modeling, containment hierarchy validation using tracer gas studies, isolator/RABS performance qualification, and cleanroom pressure cascade optimization. For new projects, we offer design-phase risk assessments using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, while existing facilities benefit from our gap analyses against current EU GMP Annex 1 and ISPE guidelines. We specialize in bridging the gap between engineering design and regulatory compliance for both traditional and advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs).',
