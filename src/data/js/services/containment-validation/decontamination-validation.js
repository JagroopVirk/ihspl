    'Our Decontamination Validation service provides scientific proof that your cleaning and sterilization processes effectively remove product residues, microbial contaminants, and cleaning agents from manufacturing equipment and cleanroom surfaces. We employ a risk-based approach aligned with ASTM E3106-18 and FDA guidance to validate both manual cleaning procedures and automated systems like Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide (VHP) generators. Our protocols include worst-case scenario testing, residue quantification (TOC, HPLC, conductivity), microbial recovery studies, and material compatibility assessments. For sterile manufacturing, we specialize in sporicidal efficacy validation using biological indicators (Geobacillus stearothermophilus) to meet Annex 1 requirements for aseptic processing areas.',
