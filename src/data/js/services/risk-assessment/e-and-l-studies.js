  full_description:
    'Our Extractables and Leachables (E&L) studies identify and quantify potentially harmful substances that may migrate from packaging, medical devices, or drug delivery systems into pharmaceutical products. Using ISO 10993-18 as a foundation, we apply simulated-use conditions and advanced techniques like GC-MS and LC-MS/MS to detect extractables and leachables in line with ICH and USP expectations. The goal is to ensure safety, regulatory compliance, and compatibility with drug formulations.',
